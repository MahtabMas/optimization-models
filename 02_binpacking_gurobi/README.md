Problem: 02_binpacking_gurobi

What this is

A small example of binpacking model in Gurobi. packing items into bins in a way that the total size of items packed in a bin never exceeds the bin's capacity.

How I set it up

Variables: x[i,j] x\in {0,1}     //item i is assigned to bin j

           y[j]   y\in {0,1}    // bin j is used

Constraints: sum(sizes[i] * x[i,j]) <= C * y[j] // total weight in each bin

             sum(x[i,j] == 1)                  //  item packed in one bin 


Objective: minimize sum(y[j]) // minimize the number of used bins

How to run

Activate my venv, then: python binpacking.py

How to change things

Edit the list "sizes" and the capacity "C" at the top of the file.

Thereâ€™s an optional "symbreak" constraint to force bins to be used in index order; you can comment it out.

Output

Prints which the number of used bins and the items assigned to each bin.
